# 📌📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard to analyze and compare road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand accident patterns, casualty trends, and key risk factors using clear KPIs and visual insights.
The primary goal is to provide a year-over-year (YoY) comparison of accidents and casualties, enabling data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements and policy planning.
The dashboard enables analysis by vehicle type, road type, location, lighting conditions, and urban vs rural areas.
🌆🌙With intuitive visuals and comparisons, the project supports better understanding of accident patterns and helps drive data-informed road safety decisions 🚦🧠.
